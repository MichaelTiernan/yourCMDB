Setup in short:
1.) Install a webserver, PHP, MySQL Server
2.) copy the yourCMDB files
3.) configure your webserver to do user authentication
4.) setup a MySQL database using the structure in sql/create.sql
5.) configure your database connection in etc/datastore-configuration.xml
6.) configure your object types in etc/
7.) start adding objects manually or using the csv import
8.) have fun :-)



1.) Install the software yourCMDB needs
yourCMDB needs the following software
- a webserver (for example Apache)
- PHP 5 with the GD and MySQL libraries
- MySQL server


2.) copy the yourCMDB files
After you installed all the software you need for yourCMDB, copy all files of yourCMDB to a directory of your choice.
For example use /opt/yourcmdb. Link the web subdirectory in your webserver's document root.
Example:
	cp yourcmdb /opt
	ln -s /opt/yourcmdb/web /var/www/yourcmdb (if your webservers document root is /var/www=


3.) configure your webserver to do user authentication
At the moment, yourCMDB has no own module for user authentication. So for authentication use the
mechanism of your webserver. 

If you use an Apache webserver, you can use the following .htaccess example file:
AuthType Basic
AuthName "yourCMDB"
AuthBasicProvider file
AuthUserFile /var/www/yourcmdb/.htpasswd
Require valid-user

Create a .htpasswd file using the command line tool htpasswd.



4.) configure your MySQL database server
create a database and a database user for yourCMDB. Use the file sql/create.sql to create
the database structure.


5.) configure your database connection for yourCMDB.
In the etc directory of yourCMDB, you'll find the configuration files of yourCMDB. Use 
datastore-configuration.xml to setup the parameters for the connection to your MySQL database
server.


6.) configure object types
Use the configuration file etc/objecttype-configuration.xml to configure your CMDB objects.
See the following example:
	<group name="network devices">
                <object-type name="router">
                        <fields>
                                <fieldgroup name="address">
                                        <field name="address1" type="text" />
                                        <field name="zip" type="text" />
                                        <field name="city" type="text" summaryfield="true" />
                                        <field name="country" type="text" summaryfield="true"/>
                                </fieldgroup>
				<fieldgroup name="network access">
                                        <field name="IP" type="text" summaryfield="true"/>
                                        <field name="SnmpCommunity" type="text" />
                                </fieldgroup>
                        </fields>
                </object-type>
		<object-type name="switch">
		[...]
		</object-type>
        </group>

Each object is part of an object group, which is displayed in the menu. Each object type has a name 
(example: router, switch) and a set of fields. The fields are organized in groups to have a better
view of an object with a lot of fields. Each fieldgroup has a name (exampl: address, network access).
Each field of an object has a name and a type (at the moment only type "text" is available). An
optional parameter summaryfield is available. Set it to "true", to show this field in the object lists,
which shows a summary of an object.

limitations
------------
object field names
- don't use dots and spaces in object field names
- don't use more than 64 characters
- don't use the following words as object field names: action, type, id, yourCMDB_*

Please see more details under http://www.yourcmdb.org


7.) Add objects
Now you are ready to add the first objects. Use the "New Object" box or the CSV import the get the
objects into yourCMDB.


8.) Enjoy yourCMDB :-)
